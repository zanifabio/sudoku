# Sudoku
This repository is just to exercise with a sudoku solver using backtracking.

The steps of this project will be:
* [ ] Creating a first implementation using backtracking
* [ ] Creating a simple UI to input the scheme and see the algorithm in action
* [ ] Letting the user play the game and check the scheme
* [ ] Generating random schemes with different levels of difficulty
* [ ] Generalize the solver to solve N x N schemes
* [ ] Generalize the solver to solve N x M schemes
